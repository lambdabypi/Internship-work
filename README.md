# Internship-work

## Assignment 3:
Design a GUI that allows a user to input an image,
encode it and then decode it.
I use PySimpleGUI to design the GUI. There were multiple
functions that i was able to access and play around with
to create my GUI, for example the '.Text()', '.Input()',
'.Multiline()', etc.

## Assignment 4:
Read LAS (LiDAR data) file, visualise using point cloud (library-open3d)
and get distance between any two points to calculate its length.

## Live Project Initial:
Design a GUI to read a LAS file and visualise its data in the form of a point cloud(as a pop up).

## Mass_weight_volume_code:
This implements "Assignment 7"s code and adds a mass calculation formula to get the weight of the model.
The goal was to figure out the weight of the actual object. Assumptions were made.
